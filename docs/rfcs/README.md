# Proposals (RFCs)

A proposal is a schema change argued before it is made: which issues it answers, the options, the cost of each
after the freeze, and what it makes redundant ([how a change happens](../process.md)). An accepted proposal
becomes a [decision](../decisions/README.md). One file per proposal, named `NNNN-short-slug.md`, written from the
[template](template.md).
