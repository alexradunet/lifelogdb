# Implementation Plans

A plan is a dated record ([how a change happens](../process.md)): a change large enough to hand to another agent,
written as a self-contained brief with done criteria. It cites the docs as they were at the commit it names. One file
per plan, `NNN-short-slug.md`, numbered on from the last.

Earlier closed plans live in git history (`git log -- docs/plans`). The next plan number is **147**.
