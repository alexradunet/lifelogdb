# D10 — Time model: UTC instants + denormalized local days, both TEXT.

**Status:** accepted

- **Decision.** The rules are `lifelog_meta.instants` and `lifelog_meta.days`, and the round-trip CHECK on every
  `*_at` and `*_day` column. An instant has milliseconds because `%f` always renders `SS.SSS`: one
  fixed-width string that the round-trip CHECK can compare, that sorts chronologically as plain text, and
  that keeps rows written within the same second in order, a reading and its correction (executed). The
  CHECK uses `IS`, because a CHECK passes when it evaluates to NULL and `date()` returns NULL for malformed
  input: `date(x) = x` silently accepts `2026-9-3` (executed). A local day is written in the zone of the
  device that captured it — a phone's, never the clock or zone of a hub on a server ([D3](D03-integer-ids.md)) — and never
  derived from the instant at query time: "the day I graduated" is a local-date fact, not an instant
  [R7](../research/references.md#r7)[R8](../research/references.md#r8)[R9](../research/references.md#r9). A timed reading's zone is a column because only capture time can supply it: a
  UTC instant alone cannot say whether `22:30Z` was 14:30, 22:30 or 07:30 the next morning. Every
  other instant is a write time, and a write time needs no zone. The DB checks the
  shape of a zone name, not that it is a real zone; readers convert with a tz database, which keeps
  renamed zones (`Europe/Kiev` → `Europe/Kyiv`) as links. The standard way to write an instant with
  its zone is RFC 9557 [R69](../research/references.md#r69): `2026-06-09T21:14:03.482Z[Europe/Berlin]` — exactly `*_at` plus `tz`.
  Provenance (`source`, `lifelog_meta.source`) is a column for the same reason as the zone: only the moment of writing
  knows it, and with agents among the writers ([D3](D03-integer-ids.md)) it is how a wrong row is traced to the writer that made it.
- **Alternatives.**
  - *Instants only, local day computed at query time*: rejected — a timezone move or DST rule
    silently rewrites history. This is why FxLifeSheet needed a dedicated `tag_days` importer to
    reconstruct local dates [R7](../research/references.md#r7), and why health-mcp denormalizes the local date at write time [R8](../research/references.md#r8).
  - *Unix epoch / Julian day integers*: unreadable in the file and in ad-hoc queries (principle 2).
    SQLite's own docs list TEXT ISO-8601 as the canonical representation [R5](../research/references.md#r5)[R6](../research/references.md#r6).
  - *SQLite `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` defaults*: rejected — second precision, non-ISO (executed) [R28](../research/references.md#r28).
