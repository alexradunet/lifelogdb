# Decision log

Each decision: **context → decision → alternatives rejected → rationale → sources.** A decision cites
the constraints that carry it; the rule itself is in [schema](../schema/README.md) or [storage contract](../contract/README.md). New decisions are written from the [template](template.md) and get the next number; a number is never
reused, and a decision that changes is rewritten in place (git is its history).

| id | decision | status |
|---|---|---|
| [D1](D01-single-sqlite-file.md) | Container: a single SQLite file. | accepted |
| [D2](D02-typed-strict-tables.md) | Typed tables with real columns, `STRICT` mode; no JSON property bags, no EAV. | accepted |
| [D3](D03-integer-ids.md) | IDs: `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`; UUIDs rejected. | accepted |
| [D4](D04-database-is-canonical.md) | Text ownership: the database is canonical. | accepted |
| [D5](D05-pages-and-day-pages.md) | One `pages` table for all prose; the journal is a page per day; titles are permanent. | accepted |
| [D6](D06-mood-is-a-measurement.md) | Mood: the `mood` metric in `measurements`, not a column on `pages`. | accepted |
| [D7](D07-measurements.md) | Measurements: one FxLifeSheet-shaped table + tiny metric registry; append-only. | accepted |
| [D8](D08-entities-and-links.md) | One `entities` supertype + one polymorphic `links` graph; a closed kind registry; symmetry in-DB. | accepted |
| [D9](D09-binary-files.md) | Files: a file the owner keeps is a page; its text is the body, a small JPEG its picture, and the original stays outside. | accepted |
| [D10](D10-time-model.md) | Time model: UTC instants + denormalized local days, both TEXT. | accepted |
| [D11](D11-tombstones.md) | Deletion: tombstones, never hard deletes. | accepted |

| [D19](D19-wikilink-save-contract.md) | The wikilink save contract: one transaction, links follow the body, a bad target never blocks a save. | accepted |
| [D20](D20-named-pages.md) | A person or a place is a page: one id, and `[[Name]]` reaches it directly. | accepted |

| [D27](D27-a-metric-is-a-page.md) | A metric is a page: its title is its name, its body its note. | accepted |
