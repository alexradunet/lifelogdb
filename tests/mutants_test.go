// A suite that cannot fail proves nothing. Each mutant is the docs tree with one rule broken — in schema.sql, in a
// cookbook block or in the text of a page — and the suite that owns the rule must notice: it must run to its end
// and fail its explicitly named rule witness (stopping on the broken document is not "noticed"). Every suite named
// here must first pass on the unmutated document. A new rule gets a mutant here (tests/README.md keeps the count).
