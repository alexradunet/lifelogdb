# Keep a photo or a file

lifelog never stores the original file: it keeps its hash, its text and a small picture. The original stays where it
is. A photo's day is the day the owner gives, else the date in its EXIF. The page of that day shows the photo when
it has a picture (step 4). lifelog does not read where a photo was taken.

1. The owner chooses the file. Never pick photos yourself from a library or a folder.
2. Call the tool `add_file` with `{"original": "/the/absolute/path.jpg", "dry_run": 1}`. Without MCP, the CLI does
   the same: `lifelog --source agent:NAME do add-file original=PATH dry_run=1 --human` (the program and its `--db` as
   AGENTS.md names them). Tell the owner what it would do: the title (the file's name, unless you send a title), the
   day, the picture.
3. A photo with no date in its EXIF gets no day, and no day page shows it: ask the owner for its day, then send
   `{"day": "YYYY-MM-DD"}` with the rest.
4. lifelog makes the picture from a JPEG, PNG or GIF. A photo of another type (a HEIC) gets no picture, and no day
   page shows it: ask the owner for a JPEG, PNG or GIF of it, then send its path too, `{"preview": "/the/path.jpg"}`.
5. A PDF or a recording: its text comes first (the owner's transcript, or a text the owner made from it), then send
   it too, `{"body": "the text"}`.
6. Without the dry run, it writes. Tell the owner the result. One call keeps one file: for several photos, call it
   once for each photo.
