// The browser view is a template per class of entity (html/*.html), and the generic one for any other class:
// properties, links, and every action as a form. A template is a view of the entity the JSON client gets: it
// reads the properties by their JSON names and places the entity's own actions, so a form is shown only where
// the API offers the action. A form posts, and the server answers with a redirect.

// The look is the Almanac design system (docs/plans/092-the-app-shell.md) bound in Hearthwood, the materials of the
// owner's Balaur design system (docs/plans/096-bound-in-hearthwood.md), in two stylesheets of this application's
// own; no framework is vendored and nothing is fetched from another host. base.css holds the tokens and styles
// ordinary HTML by element (its forms, tables, buttons and print sheet, light and dark); app.css holds only what
// this app's own vocabulary needs (the shell, its components, .wikilink, .chart), and a test keeps the two apart.
// The two are one cascade in four layers (tokens, base, components, utilities), declared once in base.css, and
// every rule is in logical properties (docs/plans/108-the-browser-made-current.md).
// The three faces are embedded files that /assets/fonts/ serves. There is one script, chat.js, which only helps the chat
// column; every form works without it (docs/plans/146-settings-and-the-chat-column.md). What a page does beyond its
// links and forms, the browser does by itself (docs/plans/108-the-browser-made-current.md).
//

// and the fonts with their licences.
