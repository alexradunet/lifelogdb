// TestTheCatalogNamesNoRemovedFeature: no action's description or field title tells a client of a feature the
// docs removed: a photo's position (D21), or the tables of tasks, deadlines and occurrences (D23). An MCP agent reads

// again, as in "plan line" and "the day it must be done by", so this test guards the removed features by their
// routes (/tasks, /deadlines, /occurrences) and by the words occurrence and reminder, not by those words. Each
// pattern names a removed feature, not a bare word, so a true text such as "due to" or the position of a row stays
