// exist, stays as it is). A wikilink target that cannot be made: the rest of the work is unaffected (syncWikilinks).
// savepoint is the one place where a Tx method catches an error of its SQL and goes on: ROLLBACK TO succeeds only
// while the transaction and the savepoint are open, so a skip cannot hide a transaction that SQLite ended. fault is
// an error of the savepoint itself, and the caller must fail the write with it: the SAVEPOINT failed, the RELEASE
// failed, or fn failed and the savepoint then could not roll back or release (a *db.RollbackError with both errors,
// as db.Write gives for a transaction). The state of the transaction is then not known. A RELEASE that fails can keep
// what fn wrote, and when SAVEPOINT or RELEASE fails because the file is full, SQLite can roll back the whole
// transaction.
